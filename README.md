# Abstractive-Text-Summarization-using-Attention-Layer
## Problem Statement
In recent years, the volume of textual data has rapidly increased, which has generated a valuable resource for extracting and analysing information. To retrieve useful knowledge within a reasonable time period, this information must be summarised.
Abstractive Summarization focuses on the vital information of the original group of sentences and generates a new set of sentences for the summary. This new sentence might not be present in the original sentence.
